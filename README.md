## Inspiration:

After finding [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new) dataset in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), we thought of leveraging this data to derive meaningful insights. 

The Data set is consists of information about the trending videos for a span of 205 days across 10 countries. "To determine the top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes)"

## Data Path:
Cleaned and merged Data is uploaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLH2adCL_qeNZOlSoaYEPUY3mfAnroHH/view?usp=sharing) as a pickle file (due the file size limitation in github)

## Insight1

**What is typically the pattern of trend ? Is it continuous trending or sporadic ?**
**Trending videos show a countinuous trend rather than intermittent**

![Total_Trending_Vs_Continuous_Trending](youtube-trending/Image/Total_Trending_Vs_Continuous_Trending.png')

**A very high correlation (0.98) between the total trend days and the maximum of  continuous trend days show Trending is a continuous pattern** 
**Also, 99% of the trendings was continuous without a break and only 1% had a break in trending**
